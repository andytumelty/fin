JQuery sortable is now broken :-(
Sort out CSV import/export again

Forget HTML, let's sort out JSON then get tests set up for each model and route

Trimming logic, defining boundaries:
- Make sure every controller has a proper JSON response

Setting up testing:
- Needs thinking about: what types of testing? Unit vs integration vs functional
  vs non-functional
- Test of every route

TESTING BUDGET BALANCES
for each non-ignored reservation, need to determine which to sum as budget
balance: amount vs balance

amount -ve, min(amount, balance)
amount +ve, max(amount, balance)
amount = 0, balance

to test:
- amount -ve, amount < balance : amount   t6
- amount -ve, balance < amount : balance  
- amount +ve, amount < balance : balance
- amount -ve, balance < amount : amount
- amount 0 : balance

edge cases:
- reservation has no transactions

What about categories with no reservations?
What about reservations of the unassigned category?

Actual requirement:
- For a budget, show me:
  - the balance of each reservation
  - the balance of any categories I've not assigned a reservation too (as "anything else")
  - the total budget balance, which is a sum of:
    - the modulus maximum of amount & balance of each non-ignored reservation




Remote account mapping

to update:
account.sync
  this.remote_account.sync

account
has_one :remote_account
default to nil? do you have to create a dummy nil remote account or just not populate it?

remote_account
belongs to account
description
inverse values (if it's a credit card you probably want this)
user_credential
remote_account_identifier

natwest
user_credential: customer number
remote_account_identifier: account number (or credit card number)
password (prompt)
pin (prompt)

amex
user_credential: username (email?)
remote_account_identifier: credit card number
password (prompt)
