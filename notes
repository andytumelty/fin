Forget HTML, let's sort out JSON then get tests set up for each model and route

Trimming logic, defining boundaries:
- Remove transaction updating crap, set up as a database view instead
- Make sure every controller has a proper JSON response

Setting up testing:
- Needs thinking about: what types of testing? Unit vs integration vs functional
  vs non-functional
- Test of every route
