Sort out CSV import/export again
Test data consistency across docker upgrades
Clear up db: remove recalc columns and delayed job tables
Add ActionController::Live to auto update data in browser
move UI to purely JSON and angular?

Forget HTML, let's sort out JSON then get tests set up for each model and route

Trimming logic, defining boundaries:
- Make sure every controller has a proper JSON response

Setting up testing:
- Needs thinking about: what types of testing? Unit vs integration vs functional
  vs non-functional
- Test of every route

TESTING BUDGET BALANCES
for each non-ignored reservation, need to determine which to sum as budget
balance: amount vs balance

amount -ve, min(amount, balance)
amount +ve, max(amount, balance)
amount = 0, balance

to test:
- amount -ve, amount < balance : amount   t6
- amount -ve, balance < amount : balance  
- amount +ve, amount < balance : balance
- amount -ve, balance < amount : amount
- amount 0 : balance

edge cases:
- reservation has no transactions

What about categories with no reservations?
What about reservations of the unassigned category?

Actual requirement:
- For a budget, show me:
  - the balance of each reservation
  - the balance of any categories I've not assigned a reservation too (as "anything else")
  - the total budget balance, which is a sum of:
    - the modulus maximum of amount & balance of each non-ignored reservation




Remote account mapping

to update:
account.sync
  this.remote_account.sync

account
has_one :remote_account
default to nil? do you have to create a dummy nil remote account or just not populate it?

remote_account
belongs to account
description
inverse values (if it's a credit card you probably want this)
user_credential
remote_account_identifier

natwest
user_credential: customer number
remote_account_identifier: account number (or credit card number)
password (prompt)
pin (prompt)

amex
user_credential: username (email?)
remote_account_identifier: credit card number
password (prompt)
