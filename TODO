TODO

- import: what happens if no amount/desc/etc... column is found?
- account (and possibly category) being blank seem to be flagged as imported successfully

- "No transactions found"
- transactions returned in batches
- filter on start date, end date
- category breakdown/spend in transactions#index

- must create account to create transaction

- category reassignment on deletion

- budgets

- bootstrap (or foundation?)
- jquery datepicker on new transaction

- mass assign account, category, delete (have a bar on bottom that follows, with selected do this:)
- ajax population, new transaction, move page

- refactor transaction (to transaction_import?) and move logic to methods in models
