TODO

- import: what happens if no amount/desc/etc... column is found?
- account (and possibly category) being blank seem to be flagged as imported successfully
- case sensitivity when looking for column headers on import
- concatenate all errors in error export, shows just first
- validate prescence of date, category, account to generate errors

- balance recalcs on update and destroy
- budget date, account_balance and balance on csv export
- budget date, account_balance and balance on csv import

- "No transactions found"
- filter by account and category

- Metrics on transaction#index and transaction#filter (collapsable div):
  - opening balance
  - closing balance
  - income
  - spent
  - category breakdown

- padding around fitler/new transaction form
- errors are highlighted under form for new transaction (see http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/forms.html error states)
- prefix for amount?

- sort by date :desc
- category order on dropdown: unassigned always first then alpha

- must create account to create transaction

- category reassignment on deletion

- budgets

- mass assign account, category, delete (have a bar on bottom that follows, with selected do this:)
- ajax population, new transaction, move page

- refactor transaction (to transaction_import?) and move logic to methods in models

- theme datepicker

- datepicker for transaction edit

- AJAX THE LOT!
