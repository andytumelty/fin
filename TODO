specify desired columns on queries to reduce query load on mem

The data structure on splits will vary, depending on how strict they need to be:
- Should you be able to group transactions with different accounts, i.e. transfers?
  And if so, what then happens if you filter on a particular account?
  This also affects looking up the last account balance, and quickly getting categorical spend
  Could add two columns, is split and parent_transaction

  has_many :children, class_name: "Transaction", foreign_key: "parent_id"
  belongs_to :parent, class_name: "Transaction"

  for indexing transactions:
  if @transaction.children.empty?
    show splits...
  end

  @transaction.parent = params :id
